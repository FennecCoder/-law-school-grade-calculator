To run this Law School GPA Calculator application correctly, you'll need to meet the following requirements:

1. Python Installation
Python 3.6 or higher must be installed on your system.

Download from Python Official Website.

Ensure Python is added to your system PATH during installation.

2. Required Python Libraries
The application uses PySimpleGUI for the graphical interface.

Installation Steps:
Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux).

Run the following command to install PySimpleGUI:

sh
pip install PySimpleGUI
(If you have multiple Python versions, use pip3 instead of pip.)

3. Running the Application
Save the code in a file named law_gpa_calculator.py.

Run the script using:

sh
python law_gpa_calculator.py
(or python3 if needed).

4. System Compatibility
Windows (Recommended) â€“ Works best due to PySimpleGUI's native integration.

macOS/Linux â€“ Should work but may require additional dependencies (like tkinter).

If you get a tkinter error, install it:

Ubuntu/Debian:

sh
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
macOS (if using Homebrew):

sh
brew install python-tk
5. Optional (For Best Experience)
Screen Resolution:

The GUI is designed for 1920x1080 but scales to other resolutions.

Virtual Environment (Recommended for Clean Setup)

sh
python -m venv law_gpa_env
source law_gpa_env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
law_gpa_env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install PySimpleGUI
Troubleshooting
